# Login-and-Registration-System

While too much security brings some problems it never hurts to have one.
Here is a project i made in regards to sign in and sign up authentication with c++.
Once the program starts and you want to sign in:
![one](https://github.com/Cheneba/Login-and-Registration-System/assets/117812926/8a137963-84b4-47b1-b60a-f57f96e1a387)
Doesn't go so you create an acount for yourself:
![two](https://github.com/Cheneba/Login-and-Registration-System/assets/117812926/4439d93c-1830-4e32-a80d-6f434a59afbe)
And attempt at logging in again:
![three](https://github.com/Cheneba/Login-and-Registration-System/assets/117812926/99a42302-99d8-4f51-bee0-7f9a76ea1eb4)
And that's it, you're in!
